# Scrabble Game version 1

For this assignment use a dictionary text file and binary search to make a Scrabble-like game.  This game will give the user 4 random letters.  

Create a Word object class and read in the Word objects into a sorted ArrayList of Words, using the text file given below.
Choose 4 random characters.
Ask the user for a word made out of the letters.
Use binary search to search in the possible Words ArrayList to see if the word is valid, and output it if it is a valid word.

Make at least one improvement to the game.  
Write your improvement as comments at the top of your game, and also comment the code that you inserted into the game to make this improvement.  
It should be at least 20 lines of quality code. Some examples of an improvement would be:

* Give the user different amounts of points for different size words.
* Allow the user to exchange one of their letters.
* Have 2 players competing for the biggest word.
* Not print out the words, and have the user guess words.

Turn in your code to your github repo that you cloned for this assignment.
